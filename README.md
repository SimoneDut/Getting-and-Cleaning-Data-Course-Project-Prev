# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Description of the project
  
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The goal is to create two tidy datasets and output the second tidy dataset to a file.

## Files in the repository
  
- `run_analysis.R`: the scrip that perform all the analysis (details in the file `CodeBook.md`)
- `CodeBook.md`: the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and work performed to clean up the data
- `output.txt`: the final tidy dataset
